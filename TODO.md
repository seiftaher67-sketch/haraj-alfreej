# TODO for CarDetails Page Edits

- [x] Update image paths to existing assets (e.g., main image to /assets/images/trucks/Frame 113.png, thumbnails to /assets/images/images/Property 1=P2.png, diagram to /assets/images/images/Property 1=P2.png, similar cars to /assets/images/images/Property 1=P2.png)
- [x] Add functionality to thumbnails to switch the main image on click
- [x] Vary the data for similar cars (different names, prices, etc.)
- [x] Ensure all text is in Arabic and RTL is enforced (already seems correct)
- [x] Confirm responsiveness and colors (yellow buttons, green badges)
- [x] Handle missing video file (remove or add placeholder)
- [x] Test interactivity (timer, modal, buttons)
